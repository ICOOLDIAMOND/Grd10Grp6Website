<h1>Q1: How we Found our Streaming Type</h1>
<h2> In this website page, my group and I will show you how we got our final streaming type</h2>
<h3> How We Chose our Original 3 Streaming Types</h3>
<p>Before we got to our streaming type, we had 3 streaming types; Interview, Educational, and Games. <br>
We particularly chose these 3 streaming types since they fit the most with our research title, which is about games and how different types of genres of games improve different senses. We'll explain in detail in how these 3 fit with our research title. <br>
<br>
<br>
Interview: We chose this streaming type so we can interview professionals who know more about this topic and others so we can spread the word that games arent all just bad <br>
<br>
Educational: We chose this streaming type so we can teach people that games arent all bad if not overused <br>
<br>
Games: We primarily just put this as filler since it is related to our research title through games rather than its benefits 
</p>
<h3> How we Chose a Streaming Type with a Survey</h3>
<p>We decided that in order for us to know what type of gaming related content our viewers would like to watch. We have decided to conduct a survey as it is the next best way we know to gather information next to conducting interviews. As you know however, we are unable to do so due to the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, we made a google form, got each member to suggest questions, and sent it out to classmates and friends so we can gather their opinion.<br>
<br>
If you want to check out the survey, heres the link: https://forms.gle/Xi2sv18LYqsLVoQV7</p>
<h3> Results of the Survey</h3>
<p>In the 16 people count as this paragraph is getting written;<br> - 14 people are grade 10 (if you add the duplicates together), 1 person is grade 7, and 1 person is grade 11.</p>

<p>- The responders decided that our content/streaming type will be Educational (5 votes on Interview, 5 votes on Gaming, 6 votes on Educational)</p>
